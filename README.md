# Next.js App

This is a modern web application built using the Next.js framework. It includes the following features:

- Server-side rendering for improved performance
- Comprehensive documentation
- Elegant error handling
- A detailed and comprehensive `README.md` file

Tech Stack:

- Next.js framework for server-side rendering and routing
- TypeScript for type checking and improved developer experience

To use the `LiquidGenerativeConvolutionalCognitiveRecurrentAttentiveAdversarialProgressiveNeuralNetwork` class, follow the example usage below:

```javascript
const network = new LiquidGenerativeConvolutionalCognitiveRecurrentAttentiveAdversarialProgressiveNeuralNetwork(
  [
    {
      filters: [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]],
      kernel_size: [3, 3],
      stride: [1, 1],
      activation: "relu"
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      hidden_size: 64,
      num_hidden_layers: 2,
      activation: "tanh"
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      hidden_size: 128,
      num_attention_heads: 8,
      activation: "sigmoid"
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      hidden_size: 32,
      num_hidden_layers: 1,
      activation: "relu"
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      hidden_size: 256,
      num_hidden_layers: 3,
      activation: "tanh"
    }
  ]
);

const mutatedNetwork = network.mutate(0.1);

console.log(mutatedNetwork);
```

Make sure to install the necessary dependencies and run the application using the appropriate commands.
